//  This file is the preliminary code for deciding whether the user has parked their car
//  The top and bottom edge of a row of parking stalls is modelled using a linear relationship. 
//  If the user's x coordinate is within the row of parking stalls, we use the linear relationship to compute
//  the y coordinate of the edge of the parking stall, and if the user's y coordinate is between those 2 values, the user is inside the parking stall.
//  We define the vector parkingDirection as the direction that the user should be moving right before they are parking their car.
//  If the angle between parkingDirection vector and the actual vector of the user's movement direction is > 20 degrees, then the user is probably not parking their car.
